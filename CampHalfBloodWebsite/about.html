            <h2 class="subheading">Major Quests</h2>
            <p>At Camp Half-Blood, our mission is to provide a safe haven where young demigods can train, grow, and learn how to harness their divine abilities. We prepare our campers to face the trials and tribulations of the outside world, equipping them with the tools they need to protect both themselves and the mortal world from ancient monsters and forces of evil.</p>
            <p>We aim to instill honor, courage, and a sense of duty in all our campers. Here, every hero is important, and everyone has a role to play in the fight for good.</p>

         <h2 class="subheading">Our History</h2>
         <p>Camp Half-Blood was founded many centuries ago by the gods themselves, with the intention of providing a sanctuary for their mortal children. Hidden from mortal eyes by the magic of the Mist, the camp remains a place where demigods from all over the world can come to train and be protected from the forces that wish to do them harm.</p>
         <p>Over time, the camp has become more than just a safe place. It's a home for many young heroes, where they build friendships, discover their strengths, and prepare for the quests they will one day undertake.</p>

          <h2 class="subheading">Activities and Training</h2>
            <p>At Camp Half-Blood, our training program is intense and varied. Campers are divided into cabins based on their divine parentage, where they receive specialized training in combat, survival, and their unique abilities. From sword fighting to archery, and from canoeing to capturing the flag, there's always something exciting to do!</p>
            <p>In addition to the physical training, campers also learn about the myths, creatures, and history of their world. Classes and workshops are led by experienced demigods and camp staff, such as Chiron, the wise centaur, who teaches many subjects, including leadership, strategy, and Greek mythology.</p>

         <h2 class="subheading">How to Become a Hero</h2>
         <p>Becoming a camper at Camp Half-Blood isn't just about being the child of a Greek god. It's about accepting the responsibility that comes with it. Demigods must prove themselves worthy of the camp's protection, and once they arrive, they quickly learn that the real test lies in their ability to protect the world from the mythological threats that lurk in the shadows.</p>
         <p>If you have the courage and strength to fight, the honor and heart to lead, and the resilience to endure, then Camp Half-Blood is your place. Welcome, hero.</p>
